Public campaigns and requests for open data may also develop if you are a public agency or state institution.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure that you publish as much open data as you can. Ask why a source of data should not be open, rather than looking for a reason to not open it. Consult with potential users on what data sources would be most useful to them if opened.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Example</strong>: Many organisations have begun to publish open data to grow their businesses and to accelerate innovation, such as <a href=\"https://www.nestoria.co.uk/help/api-appgallery\" target=\"_blank\">Nestoria</a>, whose open data is used by developers of real&ndash;estate apps and services.

If it is used extensively, and if they are a registered user, you could throttle their access to your open data - an extreme solution would be to permanently remove that organisation&rsquo;s access, or to completely &lsquo;close&rsquo; certain data sources. The best solution is to focus on continually improving your products and services, to stay ahead of your imitating competitor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Example: </strong>Some markets can be more crowded and exposed to imitation risks than others. For example, a quick search of transport apps reveals a very crowded market with many similar and overlapping products.
